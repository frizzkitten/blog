Oh hello there!

Here's a true story for you. My friend once showed me a book and said "My buddy published this collection of his own poetry." I thought "Pshh, I could write a book, I bet it's not that hard."

Two years later, here I am, fully lacking any published books. I'll admit that maybe it's harder to write a novel than I had initially thought. While it takes maybe ten hours to read a book, it turns out it takes a bit longer to actually write one. Who knew?

Anyway, I'm pretty excited about this series. Should I keep it secret that it'll be trilogy? I'm not sure. I'll update you on that later. For now, let's just keep that between you and me.

Fun fact: I had my friend read through the first couple chapters of the first draft. She told me to stop naming all the characters after my friends. Sorry Kevin and Nick, I guess you don't get namesakes. But it's okay, I probably would have killed them off in the first couple chapters.

Anyway, I plan to update this site every day or week or year or so. At a minimum, I'll definitely probably update it when I publish a new book.

Sloppy smooches,<br/>
