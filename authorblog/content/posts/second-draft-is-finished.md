The second draft of the book is done! Woohoo!

I sent it out to some of my friends. I hope they don’t totally despise it! I’m taking a break from writing for about a month now so that I can come back with fresh eyes and fresh fingies for a-typin’.

Also, I just finished my writing class! Woohoo again! Watch out JRR Tolkien, I’m coming for your crown.

I’ll write an update when the reviews from my friends have come back!

Love,
Flynn
